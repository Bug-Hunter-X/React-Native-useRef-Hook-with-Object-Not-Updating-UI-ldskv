# React Native useRef Hook with Object Not Updating UI

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where using `useRef` with an object doesn't trigger UI updates when the object's properties change. This can lead to unexpected behavior and inconsistencies in the UI. 

The `useRefBug.js` file shows the problem, while `useRefBugSolution.js` provides a solution.
