This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with an object. When the object inside the ref changes, React Native doesn't trigger a re-render, leading to UI inconsistencies or unexpected behavior. For example, if you have a ref to an object that holds scroll position, changes to that object might not update the scroll view, causing it to stay at the wrong position.
